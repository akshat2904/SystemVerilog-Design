This folder contains certain designs done using Sustem Verilog. The design for two important concepts is presented in this folder : 
Assertions and CoverGroups.

Assertions are used to validate the behaviour of a design i.e. if the design is working correctly. SystemVerilog provides two
types of Assertions : Immediate (identified with the keyword "assert") and Concurrent (identifed with the keyword "assert property")

CoverGroups record the number of occurences of various values specified as "coverpoints". Coverpoints can be referenced 
hierarchically in the testbench so that the occurence of certain values or scenarios can be recorded. covergroups may be used in 
both class-based objects or structural code.
